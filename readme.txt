jquery.as24.bind.js is a JQuery (https://github.com/jquery/jquery) plugin for bidirectional data binding between DOM elements and simple, JSON-like JavaScript objects. The purpose of this project is to allow working in a cleaner way in web forms by using a view-model (the JSON like objects) and automatically synchronize (via events) with the various bound DOM elemens (which are the views). This is a cleaner way because it allows decoupling DOM elements from each other by using observers.

This plugin was tested with JQuery versions 1.4.2, 1.4.3, 1.6.1 and 1.7.1. The minified version of JQuery 1.4.3, 1.6.1 and 1.7.1 are included here so that the tests and examples work.

jquery.as24.bind-1.3.1.min.js is the current minified version of the jquery.as24.bind.js.

In the examples folder you can find the bindingExample.html file which contains some crammed together usage examples of the data binding.

The tests folder contains the automatic tests/specs for the jquery.as24.bind.js and the needed testing framework jasmine (https://github.com/pivotal/jasmine).

This project is released under a MIT licence, so in plain English, you are allowed to use it pretty much as you like.
